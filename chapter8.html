        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage, processing, or transmission. For example, checksums and hashes are used to verify data integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Protecting personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access and misuse. Encryption and anonymization techniques are commonly used to maintain privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Restricting access to information systems to authorized users only. This is achieved through techniques like passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC).</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> The process of detecting, responding to, and recovering from security breaches or cyberattacks. This may include identifying the source of the breach, mitigating its effects, and restoring systems to normal operation.</li>
