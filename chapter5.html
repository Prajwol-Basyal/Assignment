        <h2 id="history">History of Programming</h2>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Programming</strong>, or computer programming, is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code that allows computers to perform specific tasks. 
            It is the foundation of modern computing and has evolved significantly over the decades.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The history of programming dates back to the early 19th century when <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong>, often considered the first programmer, worked on an algorithm for 
            <em>Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine</em>. However, programming truly took shape in the mid-20th century with the development of early computers such as 
            <strong>ENIAC</strong> and <strong>UNIVAC</strong>, which relied on machine code and punch cards for instructions.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            In the 1950s and 60s, higher-level programming languages like <strong>FORTRAN, COBOL,</strong> and <strong>LISP</strong> emerged, making it easier for programmers to 
            write complex instructions without dealing with raw binary code. The 1970s and 80s saw a rapid expansion in programming with the introduction of <strong>C</strong>, 
            which became the foundation for many modern languages, and the rise of <em>object-oriented programming (OOP)</em> with languages like <strong>Smalltalk</strong> 
            and later <strong>C++</strong>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The advent of personal computers in the 1980s and 90s led to the proliferation of languages such as <strong>Python, Java,</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, 
            each designed to solve different challenges in software development. The internet revolution of the late 1990s and early 2000s introduced web development technologies 
            like <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, while the increasing demand for mobile applications brought languages such as <strong>Swift</strong> 
            and <strong>Kotlin</strong> into the spotlight.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            In recent years, programming has been heavily influenced by <strong>artificial intelligence, data science,</strong> and <strong>automation</strong>, leading to the rise 
            of languages like <strong>R</strong> for statistical computing and frameworks like <strong>TensorFlow</strong> for machine learning. Today, programming continues to 
            evolve with advancements in <strong>quantum computing, blockchain,</strong> and <strong>cloud computing</strong>, ensuring that software development remains a crucial 
            and ever-changing field that drives innovation in almost every industry.
        </p>        <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
        <p>Programming, often referred to as coding, is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written using programming languages such as C, Java, Python, and many more. A program is simply a sequence of statements that the computer follows to perform a specific task, such as calculations, data processing, or controlling hardware devices.</p>
    
        <h2 id="section1">Key Programming Concepts</h2>
        <p>In this course, you will be introduced to several core programming concepts, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Variables and Data Types</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Control Structures</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Functions and Procedures</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Loops</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Arrays</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Input and Output</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms</strong></li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>1. Variables and Data Types</h3>
        <p>A variable is a named location in memory where data can be stored and accessed. Each variable is associated with a specific <strong>data type</strong>, which defines the kind of data it can store. Common data types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>int</code> - for integers (whole numbers)</li>
            <li><code>float</code> - for decimal numbers</li>
            <li><code>char</code> - for single characters</li>
            <li><code>string</code> - for sequences of characters (text)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: <code>int age = 16;</code></p>
    
        <h3>2. Control Structures</h3>
        <p>Control structures allow a programmer to control the flow of execution in a program. There are two main types of control structures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conditional Statements</strong> - These statements allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statement is the <code>if-else</code> structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Switch-Case Statements</strong> - A multi-way branch that is often used when a variable can have multiple possible values.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: <code>if (age >= 18) { // do something }</code></p>
    
        <h3>3. Functions and Procedures</h3>
        <p>Functions (also known as methods or procedures in some languages) are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are used to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. Functions can take <strong>parameters</strong> (input values) and return <strong>values</strong> as outputs.</p>
        <p>Example of a function definition:</p>
        <pre><code>int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }</code></pre>
    
        <h3>4. Loops</h3>
        <p>Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, which is useful for tasks like iterating through arrays or repeating an operation until a certain condition is met. There are two main types of loops:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Loop</strong> - Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.</li>
            <li><strong>While Loop</strong> - Used when the number of iterations is not known, and the loop continues until a condition becomes false.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: <code>for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // do something }</code></p>
    
        <h3>5. Arrays</h3>
        <p>An array is a collection of data items of the same type, stored in a contiguous memory location. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, which can be accessed using an index. This is particularly useful when you have a large number of related values.</p>
        <p>Example: <code>int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};</code></p>
    
        <h3>6. Input and Output (I/O)</h3>
        <p>Input and output operations allow the program to interact with the user or external data. Input refers to receiving data from the user or another source (e.g., a file or sensor), and output refers to displaying information to the user or sending data elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In most programming languages, input is taken using functions like <code>scanf</code> (in C) or <code>input()</code> (in Python), and output is displayed using functions like <code>printf</code> (in C) or <code>print()</code> (in Python).</p>
        <h3>7. Algorithms</h3>
        <p>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. Developing efficient algorithms is crucial for writing fast and optimized code. An example of a simple algorithm for finding the largest number in a list:</p>
        <pre><code>def find_largest(numbers):
    largest = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > largest:
            largest = number
    return largest</code></pre>

        <li><strong>Internet & Web Development:</strong> Websites, social media platforms, and cloud services are built using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Robotics & Embedded Systems:</strong> Plays a key role in robotics, automation, and IoT (Internet of Things), powering smart devices and home automation.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Improves Logical Thinking & Creativity:</strong> Enhances problem-solving skills and encourages creativity by enabling the development of digital solutions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Future of Technology:</strong> As technology advances, programming remains essential for fields like quantum computing, blockchain, and space exploration.</li>
