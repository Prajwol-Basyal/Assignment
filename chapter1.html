        <h1>Computer System</h1>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computere," which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as input, processes them according to user commands, stores them, and produces meaningful information as output. Generally, a computer works on the IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle and follows the GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle.</p>
        
        <h2>Characteristics/Features of Computers</h2>
        <p>The implementation of computers is not limited to a small area; they are used for everything from simple domestic tasks to complex scientific research. Some key features of computers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Computers are accurate machines, producing results that are 100% accurate, as errors arise from human input, not the computer itself.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Computers operate at tremendous speeds, performing millions of instructions per second.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Computers can store vast amounts of data, measured in Megabytes, Gigabytes, and beyond.</li>
            <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Computers can perform multiple tasks and solve various user requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Diligence:</strong> Computers do not tire and can perform tasks continuously until completed.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic:</strong> Once instructions are given, computers perform tasks automatically without continuous commands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications/Implementations/Uses of Computers</h2>
        <p>The uses of computers are increasing day by day, influencing every aspect of human life. Some basic applications include:</p>
