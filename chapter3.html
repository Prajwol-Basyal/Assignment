        </ul>
        <h2>Types of Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>Operating systems can be categorized into the following types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-tasking Operating Systems:</strong> These can run only one application at a time. Example: MS-DOS.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-tasking Operating Systems:</strong> These allow multiple applications to run simultaneously. Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Operating Systems:</strong> These manage network resources and allow multiple computers to connect and share resources. Example: Windows Server, Linux Server.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS):</strong> These are designed for systems requiring high reliability and real-time responses, such as embedded systems. Example: VxWorks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples of Popular Operating Systems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows:</strong> A popular operating system for personal computers, known for its user-friendly interface.</li>
            <li><strong>macOS:</strong> The operating system developed by Apple for Macintosh computers, known for its sleek design and stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Linux:</strong> An open-source operating system that is widely used for servers and desktops. Known for its flexibility and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> A mobile operating system based on Linux, used primarily on smartphones and tablets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Functions of an Operating System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> An OS manages processes, ensuring that they are executed efficiently and without conflict.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> The OS ensures that each application has enough memory to operate without interfering with others.</li>
            <li><strong>File System Management:</strong> The OS manages files on a computer, organizing them in directories and ensuring data is stored and retrieved efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> The OS enforces security policies to prevent unauthorized access to files and system resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> The OS manages hardware devices such as printers, keyboards, and hard drives.</li>
        </ul>
